# Step 1: Update Dependencies (High Priority)

## Objective
Update TypeScript types to ensure full compatibility with React 19. This step prevents type-related issues with the new React version.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Access to the project's terminal.

## Task Details
**Effort**: 1 hour
**Impact**: High

## Implementation Steps

Execute the following commands in your terminal to update the necessary development dependencies:

1.  **Update React and React DOM types:**
    ```bash
    npm install @types/react@^19.1.9 @types/react-dom@^19.1.7
    ```

2.  **ESLint has been removed from this project** - no longer needed

## Verification
After the installation is complete, run the following commands to ensure that the project builds successfully and passes all linting checks:

1.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    *Expected Outcome*: The build process should complete without any errors.

2.  **ESLint has been removed** - no linting step needed

## Rollback Procedure
If you encounter issues, you can revert the changes by checking out the previous version of `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and reinstalling dependencies:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- package.json package-lock.json
npm install
